They were supporting the body to heal from within by introducing natural chemicals back into the body. The medical team ultimately concluded that plant-based medicines, including phytocannabinoids, appeared to have real benefits without appreciable side effects, and had undeniable potential to help reduce suffering and improve patient outcomes. As we performed more research into the medicinal background of these previously taboo “alternative remedies,” it became clear to us that full-spectrum hemp-derived cannabinoids (primarily CBD) could potentially form a primary building block for a new type of solution to common ailments. <br\/><br\/>Today, MDbio develops products that restore balance (homeostasis) to the body during times of sleeplessness, anxiety, pain and other common situations. Ultimately, our doctors seek to restore not only wellness to patients, but a true “joy of living” by seeking out, testing and refining natural ingredients that support good health. <\/p>",
